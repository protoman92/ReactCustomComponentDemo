# ReactCustomComponentDemo

Demo for some custom React (Web/Native) components that I wrote/am writing, namely:

**ReactInputComponents**: https://github.com/protoman92/ReactInputComponents.
**ReactPhoneInputComponents**: https://github.com/protoman92/ReactPhoneInputComponents.

Beware that this demo does not attempt to make components look nice. Instead, it just showcases how an MVVM architecture could be used in a React/React Native application.
